                <p class="webtext">
                 Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web 
                 development include e-commerce.  Online auction sites like eBay have changed the 
                 way consumers find and buy goods and services.  Online retailers like Amazon.com
                 and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and retail hunting 
                 experience for many consumers.

                <h2>Practical web development</h2>
                 <div class="practicaltext">   
                <p>Since the commercialization of the Internet, web development has been a growing 
                    industry.  The growth of this industry is driven by companies that want to use their
                    website to sell products and services to customers. [1]</p>
                    <br><p>There is open source software for web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish,
                    LAMP (Linux, Apache, MYSQL, PHP) stack and Perl / Plack.  This has kept the cost
                    of learning web development to a minimum.  Another contributing factor to the growth 
                    of the industry has been the rise of user-friendly WYSIWYG web development software 
                    such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.  Knowledge of 
                    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or programming language is still required to use such 
                    software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly using help files, 
                    technical books, online studies, or face-to-face training.</p>               
                    <br><p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies has helped developers build more dynamic 
                    and interactive websites.  Furthermore, web developers are now helping to deliver 
                    applications as web services that were traditionally only available as applications 
                    on a desktop computer.  This has provided opportunities for many opportunities to decentralize 
                    information and media distribution.  Examples can be seen with the rise in cloud services
                    such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs.  These web services allow users 
                    to interact with applications from multiple locations instead of being tied to a specific 
                    workstation for their application environment.</p>
